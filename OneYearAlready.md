That's it, naxsi is already one year old !

On the 22nd of August 2011, naxsi\_src-alpha-v0.1.tgz was released on googlecode. Of course, lot of work was done before this, but it's still the birthday of the public existence of naxsi.

I could say many stuff about this last year and how much fun we had with the project, but I will sum it up in a few numbers :

  * 1 book with a chapter dedicated to naxsi
  * 1 magazine (BSDMag) with an article on naxsi (and another one - in french - coming)
  * 2 foreign conferences presentations about naxsi (russia - motherland of nginx, and switzerland)
  * 3 french conferences presentations about naxsi
  * 6 distributions offering naxsi packages (Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD, NetBSD, CentOS/Redhat) - Huge thanks to packagers, you are the one making naxsi available to the masses !
  * (more than) 10 tutorials about naxsi, into various langages, written by various people (most of them I never heard of, but I'm still gratefull)
  * 14 releases
  * 40 feedbacks via googledoc (in 3,5 months)
  * ~160 daily unique visitors on googlecode
  * 190+ followers on the project's twitter account
  * 430 commits
  * 900 lines of python
  * ~3000 downloads on googlecode (not the main download source anymore)
  * 3200 lines of C code
  * 4116 lines of wiki documentation
  * And a very active community !


Huge thanks to you, random internet citizen, for making all this possible !
