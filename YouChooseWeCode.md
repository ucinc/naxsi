#Help us constructing naxsi's roadmap !

# You choose, We code #

Yes that's it ! Naxsi has reached a point to where all known bugs and limitation have been dealt with, or are about to.

So, what's next ? Well, we have several options on what to put next on the roadmap, and we'd like to have your point of view ! (that's one of the points of open source after all)

  * Parsing outgoing page, to detect :
  1. Dataleaks (/etc/passwd, PHP code ...)
  1. Error triggering (SQL errors, Obvious XSS)
  1. Successful attacks ("owned by" etc.)

  * Parsing more incoming requests type :
  1. json
  1. soap/xml
  1. ...

So, what do you think ?

Please send a mail to naxsi-discuss@googlegroups.com and let us know !

Feel free to suggest more stuff as well !
