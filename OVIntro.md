#Naxsi Introduction.


# What is NAXSI #

Naxsi is a web application firewall for nginx.
To see the definition of web application firewall : [OWASP's WAF Page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Firewall)

Naxsi uses a positive approach (whitelisting), which makes it different from most firewalls.

Naxsi aims at being fast/light/scalable, meaning it can handle a lot of traffic.

The global idea behind naxsi is :
  * Setup naxsi in [LearningMode](LearningMode.md)
  * naxsi will then learn from incoming (preferably trusted) traffic
  * Extract whitelists generated by naxsi

Turning LearningMode on/off or reloading naxsi doesn't mean you have to lose active connections, thanks to nginx's design.

# Pros and Cons of naxsi #

Thanks to positive model, naxsi only needs to perform limited check on data, resulting in good performances.

Because of the positive model, you cannot expect setting up naxsi for a site with various user input/interaction without going through the [LearningMode](LearningMode.md).
